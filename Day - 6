Day 6 — Sorting & Binary Search Core

What I did

Reviewed sorting families: comparison-based (merge, quick, heap) vs counting/radix.

Binary search patterns: classic, first/last occurrence, lower/upper bound, search on answer.

Big ideas

Stable vs unstable sorts matter for multi-key data.

Binary search template sanity checks:

Monotonic condition?

Loop invariant?

Mid calc safe from overflow? mid = l + (r - l) // 2

“Search on answer” turns optimization into decision problems.

Mini reflections

Off-by-one demons returned… but tests caught them.

Next move

Practice: search rotated sorted array, find Kth smallest (heap/quickselect), allocate pages/capacity (binary search on answer).
