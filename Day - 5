Day 5 — Hashing, Sets, and Map Magic

What I did

Deep dive into collision handling (chaining vs open addressing).

Classic problems using sets/maps for O(1) average lookups.

Big ideas

When frequency matters → hashmap. When uniqueness matters → set.

Watch out for poor hash choices and integer overflow in custom hashing.

For two-sum, store what you need to find (target − x), not just what you saw.

Mini reflections

Hashmaps feel like cheating (the legal kind).

Next move

Practice: group anagrams, top K frequent elements (heap + map), valid anagram
