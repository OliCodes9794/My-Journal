Day 7 — Debugs, Catch-Up & HashMap Magic

What I did

Fixed the tiny bug in containsDuplicate (is vs in).

Cleared doubts about VS Code run button + why input() doesn’t work in the OUTPUT window.

Knocked off pending DSA roadmap problems from Days 3–5:

✅ Two Sum (#1)

✅ Contains Duplicate (#217)

✅ Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s, #53)

✅ Valid Palindrome (#125, plus peeked at the JS version).

Watched a short fun learning video to refresh vibes.

Extra: Broke down how HashMaps really work under the hood.

Big ideas

In Python: is checks identity, in checks membership — huge difference.

IDE quirks matter → VS Code’s OUTPUT isn’t the same as TERMINAL.

HashMaps = constant-time lookups when used smartly. Perfect for “seen vs unseen” problems.

Catch-up days aren’t wasted — they close loops and make you solid.

Mini reflections

Fixing small bugs myself feels 🔑 — more confident now.

Kadane’s finally feels like muscle memory.

Palindrome check across languages shows patterns repeat no matter the syntax.

Next move

Day 6 problem backlog (sorting + binary search practice).

Try a mini “HashMap only” problem set to get faster.

Maybe start writing your own mini template notes for these problems.
