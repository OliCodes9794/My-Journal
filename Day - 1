Day 1 — Warming Up: Arrays & Time Complexity

What I did:

      Set up coding environment and repo.

      Revised arrays, indexing, and common ops.

      Learned Big-O basics: O(1), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²).

Big ideas:

      Time vs space trade-offs are real. Read the constraints first.

      Indexing = super fast; shifting elements = can be costly.

      Prefix sums help turn repeated range-sum work into O(1) queries after O(n) prep.

Mini reflections:

      Felt rusty for the first 20 mins, then flow kicked in. Coffee > fear.

Next move:

      Practice: two-sum (hashmap), best time to buy/sell stock, running sum.
